### Flow of typical request flow in FastAPI:

The request is received by FastAPI and directed to the appropriate router based on the path and method.

Before reaching the router function, the request goes through the validation middleware:

 - Pydantic schemas validate the request body, query params, etc.
 - Header, cookie, security schemes are also validated.
 - After validation, any dependencies declared in the router function are resolved. This includes:
    * Database sessions
    * Authentication and security checks
    * Extracting elements from request for use in function

The router function is executed with the validated and deserialized parameters.

The router function returns the response content directly or uses **response models**.

On the way out, **response models** validate and serialize the response.

Any other middleware can process the response.

The response is sent back to the client.

So in summary:

- Request -> Router matching -> Validation and deserialization
- Execute router function -> Create response
- Serialization and validation -> Additional middleware -> Send response

The key points are that validation and serialization happen automatically before and after the router function rather than within it.
